## Description

It's a static online showcase (without payment via internet etc, as it was the client's wish), so it was developed with Angular Static Site Generation (SSG) technology, that is prerendering. The SSG technology is quite new, it was created at the end of 2023. The final bundle is a set of static files (prerendering of all pages of the site), which is stored on the server and transferred to the client when user opens the site. In this way, no time is wasted on page rendering and the site loading speed depends only on the Internet speed.
